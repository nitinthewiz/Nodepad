\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs29 To start off with, the editor (that is, this part on the right) is always writable. There's no such thing as a read-only section. You can type right on top of this, or delete it. Go ahead, try it.\par
\par
After you're done, switch away from this node to something else (say, the document \b root\b0 --that is, the node named \b Nodepad Tutorial\b0  that has nothing else above it), and come back. You'll notice that your changes are still here. That's because Nodepad automatically saves what you type--you don't need to worry about losing your work, or keeping track of open files. It's just you and your text, like it should be.\par

Go on to \b Rich text\b0 .\par
