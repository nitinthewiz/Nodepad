\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs29 The children of this node appear in alphabetical order, but that is only by default. Usually, when you're turning a document into a bunch of nodes, you want the nodes to come in the order you split them off the document. To do that, go into the \b Node\b0  menu, into \b Sort children by...\b0 , and select \b Age\b0 . That way, the new nodes will come at the end, just like you'd expect.\par
\par
Play around with the other sortings as well, and create and edit some of this node's children while doing it. Then, move on to \b Liftoff!\b0 .\par
