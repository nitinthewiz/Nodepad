\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs29 If you select these three paragraphs at once (by pressing \b Ctrl+A\b0 , for example), and Node-ify them, you'll get two weirdly-named nodes, and one \b New node\b0  node. The \b New node\b0  will be the first paragraph, although it may not end up first in the list of children; that's because we're sorting by name, not by creation time. We'll get to sorting soon.\par
\par
This is a second paragraph. It's neat, and weirdly titled.\par
\par
This is a third paragraph. It's even weirder. It also contains this warning--don't try to mix paragraphs with title lists. Mixing title and definition lists are okay, as is mixing paragraphs with definition lists. However, title lists + paragraphs cause something entirely else: \b Sectioned paragraphs\b0 .\par
