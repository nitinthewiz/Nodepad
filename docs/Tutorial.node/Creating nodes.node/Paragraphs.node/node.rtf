\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs29 This is a paragraph. It has more than one sentence in it. Nodepad considers a paragraph any text that contains a period, question mark, or exclamation point. Select this paragraph, and press Ctrl+N. This will end up as the content, but you won't get a title! Instead, it will be \b New node\b0 . You can rename it, of course (\b F2\b0 ).\par

You can't have two nodes in the same place that are both called \b New node\b0 . If you try (by, say, selecting \i this\i0  paragraph and Ctrl+N'ing it as well), the second one will end up with a weird long name. But some people like it that way, so it's okay. You can, of course, rename it (\b F2\b0 ) too.\par
